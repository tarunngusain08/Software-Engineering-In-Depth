Here's a clean, professional `README.md` you can include in your repo or documentation site, summarizing the benchmark analysis for MySQL connection pool sizing and concurrency tuning:

# üìä MySQL Connection Pooling & Upsert Performance Analysis

## Overview

This document summarizes benchmarking results aimed at determining the optimal MySQL connection pool size and concurrency settings for metrics collection agents. These agents frequently perform **upsert operations** based on **5-tuple keys and timestamps**, generating high volumes of concurrent write transactions.

Our primary goals:

* Maximize throughput
* Maintain low latency
* Minimize error rates under load

---

## üîß Benchmark Setup

* **Tool**: Sysbench `1.0.20` + LuaJIT `2.1.1727870382`
* **Test mode**: `oltp_write_only` (write-heavy workload)
* **Database**: MySQL (`test` database)
* **Table config**: 1 table, 20,000 rows
* **Test duration**: 30 seconds per run
* **Concurrency range**: 20 to 2000 threads

Each run maintained a fixed workload while increasing thread count to observe effects on throughput, latency, and error rate.

## üîç Analysis

### ‚úÖ Throughput

* **Peak TPS** occurs between **25 to 100 threads** (\~17k‚Äì20k TPS).
* Increasing threads beyond **150** yields diminishing returns.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Latency

* Low latency (1‚Äì2ms) at 20‚Äì25 threads.
* Latency increases significantly past 100 threads.
* At 500 threads: **Avg latency 46ms**, **Max latency 750ms+**

### ‚ùó Error Rates

* Low (10‚Äì50 errors/sec) at <100 threads.
* Rises sharply beyond 150 threads, reaching **600+ errors/sec** at 500 threads.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

### MySQL Server Configuration

* Set `max_connections = 150‚Äì200` based on optimal concurrency.
* Tune these parameters for heavy write loads:

  * `innodb_buffer_pool_size`
  * `innodb_log_file_size`
  * `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`

### Agent Connection Pool

* **Limit to 1‚Äì2 connections per agent**
* Use connection pooling libraries to manage reuse and avoid overload.

### Batching Strategy

* Batch multiple upserts per transaction.
* Use **multi-row upsert** statements.
* Ensure appropriate indexing on 5-tuple + timestamp fields.

### Scaling Strategy

* For thousands of agents:

  * Use **sharding or partitioning**
  * Consider **clustering** or **replication** to distribute load

### Monitoring & Alerting

* Continuously track:

  * Query latency
  * Connection counts
  * CPU/memory usage
  * Error rates
* Set proactive alerts on thresholds.
